===========

To setup go in cloud9 I dowloaded the tar file and installed it like in Ubuntu
Then add the setup for GOPATH in .bashrc and also added go/bin in .bashrc .

After that if I try to run a .go file from the terminal it does not work, but if
I run it using the Cloud9 Run command, it seems to run.
